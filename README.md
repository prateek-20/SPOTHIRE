CONCLUSION
We have successfully developed a web application which helps the students as well as Hr during the placement season. Instead of filling the google forms multiple times for different companies, it will require the students to just enter their details and resume one time and also keep them updated with the companies coming to the campus and the posts and ctc they are offering. Similarly the HR will not need to sort students manually, our portal will provide the HR with several filters he can apply and sort out the students and then view their resumes separately which makes this process easy and time efficient.
