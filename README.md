# CONCLUSION
We have successfully developed a web application which helps
the students as well as Hr during the placement season. Instead 
of filling the google forms multiple times for different
companies, it will require the students to just enter their details
and resume one time and also keep them updated with the
companies coming to the campus and the posts and ctc they are
offering.
Similarly the HR will not need to sort students manually, our
portal will provide the HR with several filters he can apply and
sort out the students and then view their resumes separately
which makes this process easy and time efficient.
